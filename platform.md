# Platform Interface Specification

This document specifies the interface between a lifecycle and a platform.

A platform orchestrates a lifecycle to make buildpack functionality available to end-users such as application developers.

Examples of a platform might include:

1. A local CLI tool that uses buildpacks to create OCI images
1. A plugin for a continuous integration service that uses buildpacks to create OCI images
1. A cloud application platform that uses buildpacks to build source code before deployment

## Platform API Version

This document specifies Platform API version `0.11`.

Platform API versions:
 - MUST be in form `<major>.<minor>` or `<major>`, where `<major>` is equivalent to `<major>.0`
 - When `<major>` is greater than `0` increments to `<minor>` SHALL exclusively indicate additive changes

## Terminology

#### CNB Terminology
A **buildpack** refers to software compliant with the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).

A **stack** is a contract, implemented by a **build image** and **run image**, that guarantees properties of the **build environment** and **app image**.

A **stack ID** uniquely identifies a particular **stack**.

A **build image** is an OCI image that provides the base of the **build environment**.

A **run image** is an OCI image that provides the base from which **app images** are built.

A **mixin** is a named set of additions to a stack that can be used to make additive changes to the contract.

The **build environment** refers to the containerized environment in which the lifecycle executes buildpacks.

An **app image** refers to an OCI image generated by the lifecycle by extending the **run image** with any or all of the following: **app layers**, **launch layers**, **launcher layers**, image configuration.

A **launch layer** refers to a layer in the app image created from a  `<layers>/<layer>` directory as specified in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).

An **app layer** refers to a layer in the app image created from the `<app>` directory as specified in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).

A **run image layer** refers to a layer in the **app image** originating from the **run image**.

A **launcher layer** refers to a layer in the app OCI image containing the **launcher** itself and/or launcher configuration.

The **launcher** refers to a lifecycle executable packaged in the **app image** for the purpose of executing processes at runtime.

An **image extension** refers to software compliant with the [Image Extension Interface Specification](image-extension.md). Image extensions participate in detection and execute before the buildpack build process.

#### Additional Terminology
An **image reference** refers to either a **tag reference** or **digest reference**.

A **tag reference** refers to an identifier of form `<registry>/<repo>:<tag>` which locates an image manifest in an [OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/master/spec.md) compliant registry.

A **digest reference**  refers to a [content addressable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage) identifier of form `<registry>/<repo>@<digest>` which locates an image manifest in an [OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/master/spec.md) compliant registry.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of terms defined in the [OCI Image Format Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) used throughout this document:
* **image config** https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/config.md#oci-image-configuration
* **imageID** - https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/config.md#imageid
* **diffID** - https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/config.md#layer-diffid

The following is a non-exhaustive list of terms defined in the [OCI Distribution Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md) used throughout this document:

* **registry** - https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#definitions

* **image manifest** provides a configuration and set of layers for a single container image for a specific architecture and operating system.

* **OCI Image Layout** format is the [directory structure](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-layout.md) for OCI content-addressable blobs and [location-addressable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage#Content-addressed_vs._location-addressed) references.

## Stacks

A typical stack might specify:
* The OS distro in the build environment.
* OS packages installed in the build environment.
* Trusted CA certificates in the build environment.
* The OS distro or distroless OS in the launch environment.
* OS packages installed in the launch environment.
* Trusted CA certificates in the launch environment.
* The default user and the build and launch environments.

Stack authors SHOULD define the contract such that any stack images CVEs can be addressed with security patches without violating the [compatibility guarantees](#compatibility-guarantees).

### Stack ID

Stack authors MUST choose a globally unique ID, for example: "io.buildpacks.mystack".

The stack ID:
- MUST NOT be identical to any other stack ID when using a case-insensitive comparison.
- MUST only contain numbers, letters, and the characters `.`, `/`, and `-`.
- SHOULD use reverse domain name notation to avoid name collisions.

### Build Image

The platform MUST ensure that:

- The image config's `User` field is set to a non-root user with a writable home directory.
- The image config's `Env` field has the environment variable `CNB_STACK_ID` set to the stack ID.
- The image config's `Env` field has the environment variable `CNB_USER_ID` set to the user [†](README.md#operating-system-conventions)UID/[‡](README.md#operating-system-conventions)SID of the user specified in the `User` field.
- The image config's `Env` field has the environment variable `CNB_GROUP_ID` set to the primary group [†](README.md#operating-system-conventions)GID/[‡](README.md#operating-system-conventions)SID of the user specified in the `User` field.
- The image config's `Env` field has the environment variable `PATH` set to a valid set of paths or explicitly set to empty (`PATH=`).
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.id` set to the stack ID.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.mixins` set to a JSON array containing mixin names for each mixin applied to the image.

The platform SHOULD ensure that:

- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.maintainer` set to the name of the stack maintainer.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.homepage` set to the homepage of the stack.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.distro.name` set to the name of the stack's OS distro.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.distro.version` set to the version of the stack's OS distro.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.released` set to the release date of the stack.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.description` set to the description of the stack.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.metadata` set to additional metadata related to the stack.

### Run Image

The platform MUST ensure that:

- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.id` set to the stack ID.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.mixins` set to a JSON array containing mixin names for each mixin applied to the image.
- The image config's `Env` field has the environment variable `PATH` set to a valid set of paths or explicitly set to empty (`PATH=`).

The platform SHOULD ensure that:

- The image config's `User` field is set to a user with a **DIFFERENT** user [†](README.md#operating-system-conventions)UID/[‡](README.md#operating-system-conventions)SID as the build image.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.maintainer` set to the name of the stack maintainer.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.homepage` set to the homepage of the stack.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.distro.name` set to the name of the stack's OS distro.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.distro.version` set to the version of the stack's OS distro.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.released` set to the release date of the stack.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.description` set to the description of the stack.
- The image config's `Label` field has the label `io.buildpacks.stack.metadata` set to additional metadata related to the stack.

### Mixins

A mixin name MUST only be defined by the author of its corresponding stack.
A mixin name MUST always be used to specify the same set of changes.
A mixin name MUST only contain a `:` character as part of an optional stage specifier.

A mixin prefixed with the `build:` stage specifier only affects the build image and does not need to be specified on the run image.
A mixin prefixed with the `run:` stage specifier only affects the run image and does not need to be specified on the build image.
A mixin WITHOUT a `build:` or `run:` prefix affects both the build and the run images.

A platform MAY support any number of mixins for a given stack in order to support application code or buildpacks that require those mixins.

Changes introduced by mixins SHOULD be restricted to the addition of operating system software packages that are regularly patched with strictly backwards-compatible security fixes.
However, mixins MAY consist of any changes that follow the [Compatibility Guarantees](#compatibility-guarantees).

### Compatibility Guarantees

Stack image authors SHOULD ensure that build image versions maintain [ABI-compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) with previous versions, although violating this requirement will not change the behavior of previously built images containing app and launch layers.

Stack image authors MUST ensure that new run image versions maintain [ABI-compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) with previous versions.
Stack image authors MUST ensure that app and launch layers do not change behavior when the run image layers are upgraded to newer versions, unless those behavior changes are intended to fix security vulnerabilities.

Mixin authors MUST ensure that mixins do not affect the [ABI-compatibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) of any object code compiled to run on the base stack images without mixins.

During build, platforms MUST use the same set of mixins for the run image as were used in the build image (excluding mixins that have a stage specifier).

## Lifecycle Interface

### Platform API Compatibility

The platform SHOULD set `CNB_PLATFORM_API=<platform API version>` in the lifecycle's execution environment.

If `CNB_PLATFORM_API` is set in the lifecycle's execution environment, the lifecycle:
  - MUST either conform to the matching version of this specification or
  - MUST fail if it does not support `<platform API version>`

### Operations

#### Build
A single app image build* consists of the following phases:

1. Analysis
1. Detection
1. Cache Restoration
1. Build*
1. Export

A platform MUST execute these phases either by invoking the following phase-specific lifecycle binaries in order:
1. `/cnb/lifecycle/analyzer`
1. `/cnb/lifecycle/detector`
1. `/cnb/lifecycle/restorer`
1. `/cnb/lifecycle/builder`
1. `/cnb/lifecycle/exporter`

or by executing `/cnb/lifecycle/creator`.

> \* **build** is an overloaded term that refers to both a single phase and the operation comprised of the above phases.
> The meaning of any particular instance of the word **build** must be assessed in context

#### Rebase
When an updated run image with the same stack ID is available, an updated app image SHOULD be generated from the existing app image config by replacing the run image layers in the existing app image with the layers from the new run image.
This is referred to as rebasing the app, launch, and launcher layers onto the new run image layers.
When layers are rebased, any app image metadata referencing to the original run image MUST be updated to reference to the new run image.
This entire operation is referred to as rebasing the app image.

Rebasing allows for fast runtime OS-level dependency updates for app images without requiring a rebuild. A rebase requires minimal data transfer when the app and run images are colocated on an OCI registry that supports [Cross Repository Blob Mounts](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#cross-repository-blob-mount).

To rebase an app image a platform MUST execute the `/cnb/lifecycle/rebaser` or perform an equivalent operation.

#### Launch
`/cnb/lifecycle/launcher` is responsible for launching user and buildpack provided processes in the correct execution environment.
`/cnb/lifecycle/launcher`, or a symlink to it (see [exporter outputs](#outputs-4)), SHALL be the `ENTRYPOINT` for all app images.

### Usage

All lifecycle phases:

- MUST read `CNB_PLATFORM_API` from the execution environment and evaluate compatibility before attempting to parse other inputs (see [Platform API Compatibility](#platform-api-compatibility))
- MUST give command line inputs precedence over other inputs

#### `analyzer`

The lifecycle:
- SHALL detect a single group from `<order>` and write it to `<group>` using the [detection process](buildpack.md#phase-1-detection) outlined in the Buildpack Interface Specification
- SHALL write the resolved build plan from the detected group to `<plan>`

When image extensions are present in the order (**[experimental](#experimental-features)**), the lifecycle:
- SHALL execute all image extensions in the order defined in `<group>` according to the process outlined in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).
- SHALL copy any generated run.Dockerfiles to `<generated>/run/<image extension ID>/Dockerfile`.
- SHALL copy any generated build.Dockerfiles to `<generated>/build/<image extension ID>/Dockerfile`.
- SHALL copy any generated `<extend-config>` files to `<generated>/build/<image extension ID>/<extend-config>`.
- SHALL replace the `run-image` reference in `<analyzed>` with the selected run image reference. The selected run image reference SHALL be the base image referenced in the Dockerfile output by the last image extension in the group.
- SHALL filter the build plan with dependencies provided by image extensions.

- For each buildpack in `<group>`, if persistent metadata for that buildpack exists in the analysis metadata, lifecycle MUST write a toml representation of the persistent metadata to `<layers>/<buildpack-id>/store.toml`
- **If** `<skip-layers>` is `true` the lifecycle MUST NOT perform layer restoration.
- **Else** the lifecycle MUST perform [layer restoration](#layer-restoration) for any app image layers or cached layers created by any buildpack present in the provided `<group>`.
- When the provided `<group>` contains image extensions (**[experimental](#experimental-features)**), the lifecycle:
  - MUST record the digest reference to the provided `<build-image>` in `<analyzed>`
  - MUST copy the OCI manifest and config file for `<build-image>` to `<kaniko-dir>/cache`

##### Layer Restoration
lifeycle MUST use the provided `cache-dir` or `cache-image` to retrieve cache contents. The [rules](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/buildpack.md#layer-types) for restoration MUST be followed when determining how and when to store cache layers.

##### Outputs

In addition to the outputs enumerated below, outputs produced by `extender` include those produced by `builder` - as the lifecycle will run the `build` phase after extending the build image. When using the `extender` platforms MUST skip the `builder` and proceed to the `exporter`.

| `100-109`       | Extension-specific lifecycle errors |

- For each extension in `<group>`, if a Dockerfile exists in `<generated>/build/<buildpack-id>`, the lifecycle:
  - MUST apply the Dockerfile to the build environment according to the process outlined in the [Image Extension Specification](image-extension.md).
- The extended image MUST be an extension of the `build-image` in [`analyzed.toml`](#analyzedtoml-toml)
- After all Dockerfiles are applied, the lifecycle:
  - MUST proceed with the `build` phase using the provided `<gid>` and `<uid>`

#### `builder`
The platform MUST execute `builder` in the **build environment**

Usage:
```

A command (`<cmd>`), arguments to that command (`<args>`), a working directory (`<working-dir>`), and an execution strategy (`<direct>`) comprise a process definition. Processes MAY be buildpack-defined or user-defined.

The launcher:

- MUST derive the values of `<cmd>`, `<args>`, `<working-dir>`, and `<direct>` as follows:
- **If** the final path element in `$0`, matches the type of any buildpack-provided process type
    - `<process-type>` SHALL be the final path element in `$0`
    - The lifecycle:
        - MUST select the process with type equal to `<process-type>` from `<layers>/config/metadata.toml`
        - MUST set `<working-dir>` to the value defined for the process in `<layers>/config/metadata.toml`, or to `<app>` if not defined
        - **If** the buildpack that provided the process supports default process args
          - `<direct>` SHALL be `true`
          - MUST replace any buildpack provided default `<args>` with any user-provided `<args>`
        - **Else**
          - `<direct>` value defined by buildpack SHALL be honored
          - MUST append any user-provided `<args>` to process arguments
- **Else**
    - **If** `$1` is `--`
        - `<direct>` SHALL be `true`
        - `<cmd>` SHALL be `$2`
        - `<args>` SHALL be `${@3:}`
        - `<working-dir>` SHALL be `<app>`
    - **Else**
        - `<direct>` SHALL be `false`
        - `<cmd>` SHALL be `$1`
        - `<args>` SHALL be `${@2:}`
        - `<working-dir` SHALL be `<app>`

##### Execution

Given the start command and execution strategy,

1. The launcher MUST set all buildpack-provided launch environment variables as described in the [Environment](#environment) section.

1. The launcher MUST
   1. [execute](#execd) each file in each `<layers>/<layer>/exec.d` directory in the launch environment, with working directory `<app>`, and set the [returned variables](#execd-output-toml) in the launch environment before continuing,
      1. Firstly, in order of `/bin/build` execution used to construct the OCI image.
      2. Secondly, in alphabetically ascending order by layer directory name.
      3. Thirdly, in alphabetically ascending order by file name.
   2. [execute](#execd) each file in each `<layers>/<layer>/exec.d/<process>` directory in the launch environment, with working directory `<app>`, and set the [returned variables](#execd-output-toml) in the launch environment before continuing,
      1. Firstly, in order of `/bin/build` execution used to construct the OCI image.
      2. Secondly, in alphabetically ascending order by layer directory name.
      3. Thirdly, in alphabetically ascending order by file name.

1. If using an execution strategy involving a shell, the launcher MUST use a single shell process, with working directory `<app>`, to
   1. source each file in each `<layers>/<layer>/profile.d` directory,
      1. Firstly, in order of `/bin/build` execution used to construct the OCI image.
      2. Secondly, in alphabetically ascending order by layer directory name.
      3. Thirdly, in alphabetically ascending order by file name.
   2. source each file in each `<layers>/<layer>/profile.d/<process>` directory,
      1. Firstly, in order of `/bin/build` execution used to construct the OCI image.
      2. Secondly, in alphabetically ascending order by layer directory name.
      3. Thirdly, in alphabetically ascending order by file name.
   3. source [†](README.md#linux-only)`<app>/.profile` or [‡](README.md#windows-only)`<app>/.profile.bat` if it is present.

1. The launcher MUST set the working directory for the start command to `<working-dir>`, or to `<app>` if `<working-dir>` is not specified.

1. The launcher MUST invoke the start command with the decided execution strategy.

[†](README.md#linux-only)When executing a process using any execution strategy, the launcher SHOULD replace the launcher process in memory without forking it.

[†](README.md#linux-only)When executing a process with Bash, the launcher SHOULD additionally replace the Bash process in memory without forking it.

[‡](README.md#windows-only)When executing a process with Command Prompt, the launcher SHOULD start a new process with the same security context, terminal, working directory, STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR handles and environment variables as the Command Prompt process.

##### Outputs
If the launcher errors before executing the process it will have one of the following error codes:

| Exit Code | Result                              |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| `11`      | Platform API incompatibility error  |
| `12`      | Buildpack API incompatibility error |
| `80-89`   | Launch-specific lifecycle errors    |

Otherwise, the exit code shall be the exit code of the launched process.

The launcher:
- MUST construct the process execution environment as described in [Launch Environment](#launch-environment)
- MUST execute the selected process as specified in the [Buildpack Interface Specfication](buildpack.md)
- SHOULD replace the lifecycle with the process in memory without forking it.

### Run Image Resolution

Given stack metadata containing `run-image.image` and a set of `run-image.mirrors`. The `<run-image>` for a given `<image>` shall be resolved as follows:
- **If** any of `run-image.image` or `run-image.mirrors` has a registry matching that of `<image>`, this value will become the `<run-image>`
- **If** none of `run-image.image` or `run-image.mirrors` has a registry matching that of `<image>`, `<run-image.image>` will become the `<run-image>`

### Registry Authentication

The platform MAY set `CNB_REGISTRY_AUTH`  in the lifecycle execution environment, where value of `CNB_REGISTRY_AUTH` MUST be valid JSON object and MAY contain any number of `<regsitry>` to `<auth-header>` mappings.
If `CNB_REGISTRY_AUTH` is set and `<registry>` matches the registry of an image reference, the lifecycle SHOULD set the value of the `Authorization` HTTP header to `<auth-header>` when attempting to read or write the image located at the given reference.

If `CNB_REGISTRY_AUTH` is unset and a docker [config.json](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/#configjson-properties) file is present, the lifecycle SHOULD use the contents of this file to authenticate with any matching registry.
The lifecycle SHOULD adhere to established docker conventions when checking for the existence of or interpreting the contents of a `config.json` file.

The lifecycle MAY provide other mechanisms by which a platform can supply registry credentials.

The lifecycle MUST attempt to authenticate anonymously if no matching credentials are found.

### Experimental Features

Where noted, certain features are considered experimental and susceptible to change in a future API version.

The platform SHOULD set `CNB_EXPERIMENTAL_MODE=<warn|error|silent>` in the lifecycle's execution environment to control the behavior of experimental features.

When an experimental feature is invoked, the lifecycle:
- SHALL fail if `CNB_EXPERIMENTAL_MODE` is unset
- SHALL warn and continue if `CNB_EXPERIMENTAL_MODE=warn`
- SHALL fail if `CNB_EXPERIMENTAL_MODE=error`
- SHALL continue without warning if `CNB_EXPERIMENTAL_MODE=silent`

## Buildpacks

### Buildpacks Directory Layout

The buildpacks directory MUST contain unarchived buildpacks such that:

- Each top-level directory is a buildpack ID.
- Each second-level directory is a buildpack version.

## Image Extensions

### Image Extensions Directory Layout

The image extensions directory MUST contain unarchived image extensions such that:

- Each top-level directory is an image extension ID.
- Each second-level directory is an image extension version.

## Security Considerations

The platform SHOULD run each phase of the lifecycle in an isolated container to prevent untrusted app and buildpack code from accessing storage credentials needed during the export and analysis phases.
A more thorough explanation is provided in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).

## Additional Guidance

### Environment
#### Buildpack Environment
##### Stack-Provided Variables
The following variables SHOULD be set in the lifecycle execution environment and SHALL be directly inherited by the buildpack without modification:
| Env Variable    | Description
|-----------------|--------------------------------------
| `CNB_STACK_ID`  | Chosen stack ID
| `HOME`          | Current user's home directory

The following variables SHOULD be set in the lifecycle execution environment and MAY be modified by prior buildpacks before they are provided to a given buildpack:

| Env Variable      | Layer Path   | Contents
|-------------------|--------------|------------------
| `PATH`            | `/bin`       | binaries
| `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` | `/lib`       | shared libraries
| `LIBRARY_PATH`    | `/lib`       | static libraries
| `CPATH`           | `/include`   | header files
| `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` | `/pkgconfig` | pc files

The platform SHOULD NOT assume any other stack-provided environment variables are inherited by the buildpack.

##### User-Provided Variables
User-provided environment variables MUST be supplied by the platform as files in the `<platform>/env/` directory.
Each file SHALL define a single environment variable, where the file name defines the key and the file contents define the value.

User-provided environment variables MAY be modified by prior buildpacks before they are provided to a given buildpack.

The platform SHOULD NOT set user-provided environment variables directly in the lifecycle execution environment.

The `<platform>/env/` directory follows the same convention as [Environment Variable Modification Rules](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/buildpack.md#environment-variable-modification-rules).

##### Operator-Defined Variables
Operator-provided environment varaiables MUST be supplied by the platform as files in the `<build-config>/env/` directory.

Each file SHALL define a single environment variable, where the file name defines the key and the file contents define the value.

Operator-defined environment variables MAY be modified by subsequent buildpacks before they are provided to a given buildpack.

The platform SHOULD NOT set operator-provided environment variables directly in the lifecycle execution environment.

The `<build-config>/env/` directory follows the [Environment Variable Modification Rules](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/buildpack.md#environment-variable-modification-rules) outlined in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md), except for the modification behavior when no period-delimited suffix is provided; when no suffix is provided, the behavior is `default`.

#### Launch Environment
User-provided modifications to the process execution environment SHOULD be set directly in the lifecycle execution environment.

The process SHALL inherit both stack-provided and user-provided variables from the lifecycle execution environment with the following exceptions:
* `CNB_APP_DIR`, `CNB_LAYERS_DIR` and `CNB_PROCESS_TYPE` SHALL NOT be set in the process execution environment.
* `/cnb/process` SHALL be removed from the beginning of `PATH`.
* The lifecycle SHALL apply buildpack-provided modifications to the environment as outlined in the [Buildpack Interface Specification](buildpack.md).

### Caching

If caching is enabled the platform is responsible for providing the lifecycle with access to the correct cache.
Whenever possible, the platform SHOULD provide the same cache to each rebuild of a given app image.
Cache locality and availability MAY vary between platforms.

### Build Reproducibility
When given identical inputs all build and rebase operations:
   - SHOULD produce app images with identical imageIDs
   - **If** exporting directly to a registry
       - SHOULD produce app images with identical manifest digests
   - MAY output other non-reproducible artifacts

To achieve reproducibility the lifecycle SHOULD set the following to a constant, rather than an accurate value:
- file modification times in generated layers
- image creation time

Because compressions algorithms and manifest whitespace affect the image digest, an app image exported to the docker daemon and subsequently pushed to a registry MAY have a different digest than an app image exported directly to a registry by the lifecycle, even when all other inputs are held constant.

If buildpacks do not generate layer contents or layer metadata reproducibly, builds MAY NOT be reproducibile even when identical source code and buildpacks are provided to the lifecycle.

All app image labels SHOULD contain only reproducible values.

For more information on build reproducibility see [https://reproducible-builds.org/](https://reproducible-builds.org/)

### Map an image reference to a path in the layout directory

An **image reference** refers to either a **tag reference** or a **digest reference**:
- A tag reference refers to an identifier of form `<registry>/<repo>/<image>:<tag>`
- A digest reference refers to a content addressable identifier of form `<registry>/<repo>/<image>@<algorithm>:<digest>`

The image reference will be mapped to a path in the layout directory following these rules:
  - **If** the image points to a tag reference:
    - The path MUST be `<layout-dir>/<registry>/<repo>/<image>/<tag>`
  - **Else if** the image points to a digest reference:
    - The path MUST be `<layout-dir>/<registry>/<repo>/<image>/<algorithm>/<digest>`
